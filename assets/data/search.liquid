There’s a lot to the mod that may seem complicated to even more experiencedusers, but this short guide will help you get the hang of things.What is Twitch Toolkit?Twitch Toolkit is a mod by hodlhodl that allows viewers to affect the game in a number of ways. Themost prominent is its store, which allows you to purchase a number ofthings the streamer curated. Depending on the purchase, these things appear in-game or affect thegame in some way. Another way viewers can interact with the game is through the mod’s polls. Thechoices in these polls depend heavily on what’s enabled in the mod.What Are Coins?Coins are the mod’s currency. You can view your balance by using the !bal command.What is Karma?Karma is a system in the mod that tries to limit the amount of negative events a viewer can purchase atone time. This system works by directly modifying that amount of coins viewers get everytime the modawards coins. This means that the lower you karma is, the lower your coin gain is. The hope is thatnegative events get spread out more so the colony can recover.How Do I Use Twitch Toolkit?You can use Twitch Toolkit in a number of ways – the most prominent way is through itscommands. The more important command is the !buycommand, which is the mods entry point into purchasing things from the store. Other notable commandsare the !mypawn commands, which allow you see various information about your pawn. We won’t coverevery command here, but most commands should generally be self-descriptive or have a description ofwhat they do on the commands page." }, { "title" : "Mod List", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/itemlist/modlist", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Advanced Power Plus sulusdacor, james76543, Meltup and leugimimi All Turrets Can Set Forced Target ...", "content" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Advanced Power Plus sulusdacor, james76543, Meltup and leugimimi All Turrets Can Set Forced Target BaalEvan Allow Tool UnlimitedHugs Almost There!
